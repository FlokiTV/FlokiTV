# 👋 Hi! I'm Floki 

My name is Wüster, but everyone calls me Floki. I am 27 years old and since the age of 15 I have been venturing into the programming world. I grew up in the web and learned a lot from it.

Full stack developer with 7+ years building web sites and solutions for the internet. Throughout my career I've built websites, e-commerce sites, HTML5 Games with javascript and android applications. Large experiencie with linux servers and hosting applications.

In the last few years, I'm focused on game development. I found GDevelop, a low-code game engine, that supports javascript.
I worked a long time with GDevelop, building games, extensions, and experiments. Everything can be found as open source on my github.

A little while ago I found FiveM. It's like a game engine on top of GTA 5. And the best, with JavaScript support.
So I've been working on jsRP, a js toolkit to help develop resources in an organized and fast way.
