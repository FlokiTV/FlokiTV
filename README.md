# üëã Hi! I'm Floki 

My name is W√ºster, but everyone calls me Floki. I am 27 years old and since the age of 15 I have been venturing into the programming world. I grew up in the web and learned a lot from it.

Full stack developer with 7+ years building web sites and solutions for the internet. Throughout my career I've built websites, e-commerce sites, HTML5 Games with javascript and android applications. Large experiencie with linux servers and hosting applications.

In the last few years, I'm focused on game development. I found GDevelop, a low-code game engine, that supports javascript.
I worked a long time with GDevelop, building games, extensions, and experiments. Everything can be found as open source on my github.

A little while ago I found FiveM. It's like a game engine on top of GTA 5. And the best, with JavaScript support.
So I've been working on jsRP, a js toolkit to help develop resources in an organized and fast way.

    The jsRP is a toolkit developed in raw Javascript to be a framework with a default pattern to help develop resources in an organized way.

    - Work in Progress

 ### GAME ON by Ruby Rose
    This game has been developed as marketing to launch a new make-up with a "gamer" theme.
    The game is inspired by old PacMan. I tried to remake all behaviors from the original ghosts and develop a touch joystick to control the main character.
    The development was in a team, where I was responsible for all programming
    Made with GDevelop and Javascript

 # GDevelop Extensions and proof of concepts
 
 #### GDevelop Maker
 This mini-game has been developed to show an extension I has created to automatically pick the right image on the tileset ([AutoTile](https://github.com/FlokiTV/GDevelop-AutoTile)) and draw the ground.

 #### GDevelop Plane Projection
 This technique uses the skew to allow drawing some images as a plane. When the camera rotates, the plane will apply a new angle and calculate de skew x and y to make the fake 3D.
