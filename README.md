# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Floki 

My name is WÃ¼ster, but everyone calls me Floki. I am 27 years old and since the age of 15 I have been venturing into the programming world. I grew up on the web and learned a lot from it.

Full stack developer with 10+ years building websites and solutions for the internet. Throughout my career, I've built websites, e-commerce sites, HTML5 Games with javascript and Android applications. Large experience with Linux servers and hosting applications.

In the last few years, I'm focused on game development. I found GDevelop, a low-code game engine, that supports javascript.
I worked a long time with GDevelop, building games, extensions, and experiments. Everything can be found as open source on my GitHub.

# ðŸ—‚ Projects
 Here I will list some projects that I participated. Some commercials and some not.
 
 ### Magalu Multiplayer Experience
    Online co-op game, based on 360Â° equirectangular image with escape room elements. 
    As dev solo, I built the server and client with room system to able multiple game sessions. 
    I wrote from scratch with javascript

 ### GAME ON by Ruby Rose
    This game has been developed as marketing to launch a new make-up with a "gamer" theme.
    The game is inspired by old PacMan. 
    I tried to remake all behaviors from the original ghosts 
    and develop a touch joystick to control the main character.
    The development was in a team, where I was responsible for all programming
    Made with GDevelop and Javascript

 # GDevelop Extensions and proof of concepts
 
 #### GDevelop Maker
 This mini-game has been developed to show an extension I have created to automatically pick the right image on the tileset ([AutoTile](https://github.com/FlokiTV/GDevelop-AutoTile)) and draw the ground.

 #### GDevelop Plane Projection
 This technique uses the skew to allow drawing some images as a plane. When the camera rotates, the plane will apply a new angle and calculate de skew x and y to make the fake 3D.
